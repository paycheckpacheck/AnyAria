# Test 11: Add Net to Existing Unconnected Components

## What This Tests

**Core Question**: When you have unconnected components in a KiCad schematic and add a net connection in Python code, do the hierarchical labels appear when regenerating?

This tests **bidirectional sync for net creation** - adding electrical connections (via hierarchical labels) to existing components.

## When This Situation Happens

- Developer generates circuit with unconnected components (R1, R2)
- Later decides components should be electrically connected
- Adds `Net("NET1")` in Python code connecting the pins
- Regenerates KiCad expecting hierarchical labels to appear

## What Should Work

1. Generate initial KiCad with R1 and R2 (no connection, no labels)
2. Manually verify components are unconnected in KiCad (no labels visible)
3. Edit Python to add Net connecting R1[1] to R2[1]
4. Regenerate KiCad project
5. Hierarchical labels "NET1" appear on both component pins, establishing electrical connection

## Manual Test Instructions

```bash
cd /Users/shanemattner/Desktop/circuit-synth/tests/bidirectional/11_add_net_to_components

# Step 1: Generate initial KiCad project (no connection)
uv run two_resistors.py
open two_resistors/two_resistors.kicad_pro
# Verify: R1 and R2 visible but NO hierarchical labels (completely unconnected)

# Step 2: Edit two_resistors.py to add net connection
# Change import line to:
#   from circuit_synth import circuit, Component, Net
# Add before the end of the function (after r2 definition):
#   net1 = Net(name="NET1")
#   net1 += r1[1]
#   net1 += r2[1]

# Step 3: Regenerate KiCad project with connection
uv run two_resistors.py

# Step 4: Open regenerated KiCad project
open two_resistors/two_resistors.kicad_pro
# Verify:
#   - Hierarchical labels "NET1" now appear on R1[1] and R2[1]
#   - NO physical wire between components
#   - Electrical connection established by matching label names
#   - R1 and R2 positions preserved (didn't move)
#   - Components still no overlap
```

## Expected Result

- ✅ Initial generation: R1 and R2 unconnected (no labels)
- ✅ After adding Net in Python: hierarchical labels "NET1" appear
- ✅ Labels on both R1[1] and R2[1] pins (square flag shapes)
- ✅ NO physical wire between components
- ✅ Electrical connection established by matching label names
- ✅ Component positions preserved during regeneration
- ✅ No duplicate components
- ✅ Connection is electrically valid (no ERC errors)

**Note**: Uses `hierarchical_label` format - labels create electrical connection without wires

## Why This Is Important

**Iterative circuit development workflow:**
1. Generate initial circuit structure (components only)
2. Review component placement in KiCad
3. Add electrical connections in Python (Net objects)
4. Regenerate - hierarchical labels appear, establishing connections without losing layout

If this doesn't work, users must define all nets upfront or manually add labels in KiCad (defeating the purpose of code-based design).

## Success Criteria

This test PASSES when:
- Unconnected components generate correctly initially (no labels)
- Adding Net() in Python creates hierarchical labels in KiCad
- Labels appear on both component pins with matching names
- NO physical wires drawn
- Component positions preserved across regeneration
- No electrical rule errors in KiCad
