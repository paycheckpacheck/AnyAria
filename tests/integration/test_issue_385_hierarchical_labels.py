Test for Issue #385: Missing hierarchical labels on component pins in generated schematics.

The schematic writer was using a non-existent API (net.connections) instead of the correct
API (net.pins). This test validates that hierarchical labels are properly generated.

Test strategy:
1. Create a simple resistor divider circuit with named nets
2. Generate KiCad schematic
3. Verify hierarchical_label elements exist in the .kicad_sch file
4. Verify label names match the net names
5. Verify labels appear for each pin connected to a net

        Test that a simple resistor divider generates hierarchical labels for non-power nets.

        Circuit structure:
        - R1 (1k): pin 1 = VIN_5V, pin 2 = VOUT_3V3
        - R2 (2k): pin 1 = VOUT_3V3, pin 2 = GND_SENSE (NOT GND)

        Expected hierarchical labels in .kicad_sch:

        - VOUT_3V3 (on R1 pin 2 and R2 pin 1)
        - GND_SENSE (on R2 pin 2) - not GND because GND is auto-detected as power net

        This test verifies the fix for Issue #385:
        The circuit loader was looking for "connections" key in JSON nets,
        but NetlistExporter uses "nodes" key instead.
